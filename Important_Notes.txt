Please also tell a way that will storing the price record will creates a large file?
And if it does, what can be the solution to solve this problem?

Storing price records over time can indeed result in a large file, especially if you're recording prices for a large number of products and the price data frequently changes. To manage this issue, you can implement strategies to efficiently store and manage the historical price data:

Data Aggregation: Instead of recording every price change individually, you can aggregate data over time. For example, you could store the daily or weekly average price for a product rather than every price change.

Data Retention Policy: Implement a data retention policy to limit the amount of historical data you keep. Define how long you want to retain price records, and regularly purge records that exceed this retention period.

Database Partitioning: If you're using a relational database for price storage, consider partitioning the data by time. This involves splitting the database table into smaller, manageable partitions based on a time interval (e.g., monthly or yearly). Older partitions can be archived or deleted as needed.

Compress Historical Data: Implement data compression techniques to reduce the storage footprint of historical records. You can compress data before storing it or use database features for data compression.

Data Archiving: Move older historical data to an archival storage system. This keeps the data accessible but reduces the load on your primary database.

Database Sharding: If your dataset is exceptionally large, consider sharding your database. Sharding involves splitting the data into smaller, more manageable chunks distributed across different servers or databases.

NoSQL Databases: Depending on the nature of your data, a NoSQL database may be more suitable for handling large amounts of time-series data. NoSQL databases like Cassandra or InfluxDB are designed for efficient time-series data storage.

Cloud Storage: Consider using cloud-based storage solutions like Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage for storing historical price records. These services offer scalability and cost-effectiveness for managing large datasets.

Data Downsampling: If minute-level granularity isn't necessary for historical data, you can downsample it. For example, store hourly averages instead of minute-level data.

Data Pruning: Implement a mechanism to automatically prune outdated or irrelevant data. For example, if you're tracking prices for perishable goods, you might not need data that's more than a year old.

Your choice of strategy will depend on your specific use case and requirements. Combining several of these strategies can help you efficiently manage and store historical price data without creating excessively large files.
